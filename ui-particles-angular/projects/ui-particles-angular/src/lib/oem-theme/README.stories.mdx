# OEM Theme

## Overview

With an OEM License, the user can customize the theme of the APIM Console.

ðŸš§ Coming soon: Find out more about the OEM License and how to integrate the license into your current Gravitee environment ðŸš§

## Menu + Top Bar

The color of the Menu + Top Bar is customizable with two specifications: `menuBackground` and `menuActive`.

The `menuBackground` property designates the color of the main panel and top bar of the component. This is also the color that the sub-menu is based upon.

The `menuActive` is the color of the active menu item as well as the notification color in the top bar. Hovers over menu items are also calculated from the `menuActive` value.

You can test color combinations in the [ Menu + Top Bar](../?path=/story/oem-theme-menu-top-bar--default) with the Controls included in the story.

ðŸš§ For now, only white text is possible for menu customization. ðŸš§
