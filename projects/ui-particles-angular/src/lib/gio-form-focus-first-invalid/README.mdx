# Form Focus invalid

Try to scroll and focus on the first invalid field of a form.
The FormFocusInvalid get all invalid fields in parent form and find the first one to focus on.

## Usage

### On submit form

Add this directive to the form element. When the form is submitted, the first invalid field will be focused.

Example :

```html
<form gioFormFocusInvalid>
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

### On click button

Add this directive to the button element. When the button is clicked, the first invalid field will be focused.

Example :

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <button type="button" gioFormFocusInvalid>Go to first form error</button>
</form>
```

### Ignore fields

Add this directive `gioFormFocusInvalidIgnore` to the field to ignore it.
As the FormFocusInvalid get all invalid fields in parent form this directive will ignore the field to allow to focus on the next one.

You can also add this attribute to host component (like custom form control) always to ignore it. If the component itself contains form elements it allows to focus on them.

```ts
import {GIO_FORM_FOCUS_INVALID_IGNORE_SELECTOR} from "@gravitee/ui-particles-angular";

...

@Component(...)
export class CustomFormComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
  ...
  @HostBinding(`attr.${GIO_FORM_FOCUS_INVALID_IGNORE_SELECTOR}`)
  private gioFormFocusInvalidIgnore = true;
  ...
}
```
