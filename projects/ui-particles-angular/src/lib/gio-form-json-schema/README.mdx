# Form Json schema

Dynamic form display [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/) powered used in reactive forms.

Uses the library https://github.com/ngx-formly/ngx-formly and extends it with custom components.

## Installation

To use this component you need to add optional dependencies to your project:

```bash
yarn add @ngx-formly/core @ngx-formly/material
```

## Usage

To create a form based on a json schema, you can include this component like this. With ReactiveForm

```html
<gio-form-json-schema
  [jsonSchema]="jsonSchema"
  [options]="options"
  formControlName="formControl"
></gio-form-json-schema>
```

## JSON schema

The jsonSchema object passed to the component is of type `GioJsonSchema`, which is an extension of [JsonSchema7](https://jsonforms.io/api/core/interfaces/jsonschema7.html) type, plus some Gravitee specific options.

### Banner

In some case, we want to display some guidance to the user that would not fit in the `mat-hint` field in `mat-form-field`. For such cases, we can use banners like follows.

{/* <Story id="components-form-json-schema--field-with-banner" /> is deprecated, please migrate it to <Story of={referenceToStory} /> see: https://storybook.js.org/migration-guides/7.0 */}

<Story id="components-form-json-schema--field-with-banner" />

ðŸš§ **Note**: This component is in development.
