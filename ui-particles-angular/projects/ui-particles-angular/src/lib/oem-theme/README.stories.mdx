# OEM Theme

## Overview

With an OEM Customization License, the user can customize the theme of the APIM Console.

## Menu + Top Bar

The color of the Menu + Top Bar is customizable with two specifications: `menuBackground` and `menuActive`.

The `menuBackground` property designates the hexcode color of the main panel and top bar of the component. This is also the color that the main sub-menu is based upon.

The `menuActive` is the hexcode color used for the active menu item background as well as the notification counter in the top bar. Hovers over menu items are calculated from the `menuActive` value.
This value is also used as the basis for the [Light Submenu](../?path=/story/oem-theme-submenu--light).

You can test color combinations in the [ Menu + Top Bar](../?path=/story/oem-theme-menu-top-bar--default) with the Controls included in the story.

ðŸš§ For now, only white text is possible for menu customization. ðŸš§


## Logo

The icon displayed in the top bar can also be customized.
You can have a look at the stories [Top Bar](../?path=/story/oem-theme-topbar--default) or [ Menu + Top Bar](../?path=/story/oem-theme-menu-top-bar--default) and set your logo as base64 data URI in the controls.
